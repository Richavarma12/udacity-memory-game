## About

This project has helped me showcase my HTML,CSS and Javascript skills. 
This is a memory game where you need to try to find a matching tile.


## How to play?

There are 16 tiles, 4 in each row/column where the player needs to match the icon by fliping the tile one by one. If the tiles match then they will flip open or else they will be fipped down.

## How to install the game locally?

You can download or clone the zipped file on your local machine and open index.html in any browser to play.
